  <h1> About </h1>
  <!-- Description start -->
  <p>I love to understand things clearly, especially things which work towards solving complex problems. The problem spaces of my interest are Mathematics in general and Computer Science.</p>
  <p>I work as <span class="uncool-link"><b>Machine Learning Engineer</b></span> at Netcore. I ventured into this field of Data after a brief overview at a tech meetup. That abstract idea of making machines learn from data had fascinated me. Ever since then I have overwhelmed myself with many books, courses and projects to get a deep understanding of the fundamentals, theory and practicality of this field, good enough to engineer some powerful implementations in multiple domains like NLP, Computer Vision etc.</p>
  <p>I have class apart software development experience both at professional and personal level. I have designed many open-source python frameworks/libraries and have also crafted novel algorithms. Having worked as both Data Engineer and Scientist, I have been part of core team in Designing and building backend architectures from scratch, be it developing scalable ETL pipelines or procuring & processing continuously streamed data from sensors and data sources mounted throughout the world using state of the art cloud solutions/technologies.</p>
  <p>Professionally I am a <span class="about-description-highlight">Computer Engineer</span>, I keep myself updated on the nuances and discoveries in my field by either going through blogs, online courses or hands-on projects. I like to read books that teach, basically anything that can positively impact my skills.</p>
  <p>I stay close to the community and also keep tabs with the pace at which it is evolving.</p>
